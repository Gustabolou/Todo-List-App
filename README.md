## Code Explanation
### HTML (`index.html`)
- Main structure of the application.
- Contains the input field for new tasks and the task list.

### CSS (`style.css`)
- Responsive styling with an elegant, modern layout.
- Uses a gradient for the background and a white card to highlight the content.

### JavaScript (`script.js`)
- **`addTask()`**: Adds a new task to the list. If the input field is empty, an alert message is displayed.
- **`saveData()`**: Saves tasks to `localStorage` to preserve data even after the page is reloaded.
- **`displayTask()`**: Displays the saved tasks when the app starts.
- **Event Listener**: Allows you to mark a task as completed or remove it.
